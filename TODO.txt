Faithful, One Hundred Percent

Loosely based on Horton Hears a Who:
- Player finda a clover
- Player can sit down and talk to clover. As he does, the world fades around him 
  and he envisions what he sees there
  - Speech bubbles appear from the player and the flower alternately as they talk.
- Little denziens of forest attack player
  - Look like circles and triangles
  - Player can guard and fend them off, but cannot fend and talk to clover at same time
  - (Guards are perfect guards - if you get attacked, you lose HP)
  - If you can't take another hit, the clover is stolen from you and you lose (SUCCUMB ENDING)
- Player will walk with clover to defend it
  - Player must continually talk to clover to establish contact and belief.
  - If player neglects clover, they will eventually begin to doubt what they heard, which
    will show in the coloring around the player. Eventually, the player will discard the
	clover and leave, ending the game. (UNFAITHFUL ENDING)
- As the player advances, they will face stronger attacks, and will eventually come
  across a large flower.
  - Player will investigate flower and see that it would be a safe place.
  - Player will leave their clover there, and can freely walk left or right.
  - They can also talk to the clover in this state, which will reveal a slightly different
    conversation.
  - If they walk left off the screen without their clover, they take a look back for a bit,
    then walk away, ending the game. (NORMAL ENDING)
  - However, they can also take the clover and continue, more determined than ever to save them.
- In the final segment, talking becomes constant, and the player has no risk of disbelief
  because talking is effortless and natural to them. And that's a good thing, because the
  attacks are also more difficult than ever.
  - The player can still be subdued in this state, which will also end the game.
  - Defending becomes juiced as more monsters appear and assail the player.
- As the last wave tapers off and the player books away, they eventually collapse in a clearing.
  As they wait there, another character like the player walks onscreen from the right, noticing
  the player lying there. She helps the player up, sits down with them, and says hello. The
  flower says hello back, and the three of them begin to talk as the world fades to white,
  ending the game. (TRUE FAITHFUL ENDING)
