# Slime Highways
## A game about cells and cell masses for Ludum Dare 38.

Ride the currents to eat other cells, or just enjoy life as a floating, amorphous blob. 
Enjoy this as a maze game or just as a screensaver. 
Use arrows to shift weight in current, or to traverse walls when stuck to them.
Move away from walls or press Z to dislodge yourself into the current.

## Development Information

This game was developed in [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a "fantasy console" by Lexaloffle Games. 
It provides a 128x128, 16 color canvas and tilemap that can be programmed using a built-in Lua scripting environment.
The game can be played for free, and the full console runtime with development tools can be bought for $14.99 USD
from Lexaloffle's website, for Windows, Mac, Linux, or Raspberry PI.

To install and run this game from the repository:

1. Open PICO-8
2. Type "FOLDER" in PICO-8 to open PICO-8's directory tree in your system's file explorer
3. Drag the cartridge file anywhere within that directory tree. (In fact, it is actually safe to clone the entire repository to 
   somewhere in that directory tree - PICO-8 will simply ignore non-cartridge files)
4. Use "CD" and "LS" within PICO-8 to navigate to the cartridge folder
5. Type "LOAD GAME.P8"
6. Type "RUN"
